## What is a Conda environment?

A [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html)
is a directory that contains a specific collection of Conda packages that you have installed. For
example, you may be working on a research project that requires [NumPy
1.24.1](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.24.1) and its dependencies, while another environment associated
with an finished project has [NumPy 1.12.1](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.12.1) (perhaps because
version 1.12 was the most current version of NumPy at the time the project finished). If you change one environment,
your other environments are not affected. You can easily activate or deactivate environments, which is how you switch
between them.

> ## Avoid installing packages into your `base` Conda environment
>
> Conda has a default environment called `base` that includes a Python installation and some core system libraries and
> dependencies of Conda. It is a "best practice" to avoid installing additional packages into your `base` software
> environment as this can cause dependency complications further down the line.  Additional packages needed for a new
> project should always be installed into a newly created Conda environment.

> Conda has a built in help system that can be called from the command line if you are unsure of the commands/syntax to
> use.

> If you want to read the help on a specific sub-command/action then use `conda <action> --help` for example to read the

## Creating environments

To create a new environment for Python development using `conda` you can use the `conda create` command.

~~~
conda create --name basic-scipy-env
~~~

{: .language-bash}

For a list of all commands, take a look at [Conda general commands](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands.html).

It is a good idea to give your environment a meaningful name in order to help yourself remember
the purpose of the environment. While naming things can be difficult, `$PROJECT_NAME-env` is a
good convention to follow. Sometimes including the version of Python you created the environment
with is useful too.

The command above created a new Conda environment called `basic-scipy-env` and installed a recent
version of Python (3.10 if you downloaded the most recent install script). You can however specify a specific version of
Python for `conda` to install when creating the environment by adding a version number e.g. to `python=3.8`.

~~~
conda create --name python38-env python=3.8
~~~

{: .language-bash}

## Activating an existing environment

Activating environments is essential to making the software in environments work well (or sometimes at all!). Activation
of an environment does two things.

1. Adds entries to `$PATH` for the environment.
2. Runs any activation scripts that the environment may contain.

Step 2 is particularly important as activation scripts are how packages can set arbitrary environment variables that may
be necessary for their operation. You activate the `basic-scipy-env` environment by name using the `activate` command.

~~~
conda activate basic-scipy-env
~~~

{: .language-bash}

You can see that an environment has been activated because the shell prompt will now include the name of the active
environment.

~~~
(basic-scipy-env) $
~~~

{: .challenge}

## Deactivate the current environment

To deactivate the currently active environment use the Conda `deactivate` command as follows.

~~~
(basic-scipy-env) $ conda deactivate
~~~

{: .language-bash}

You can see that an environment has been deactivated because the shell prompt will no longer
include the name of the previously active environment, but will return to `base`.

~~~
(base) $
~~~

> ## Returning to the `base` environment
>
> To return to the `base` Conda environment, it's better to call `conda activate` with no
> environment specified, rather than to use `deactivate`. If you run `conda deactivate` from your
> `base` environment, you may lose the ability to run `conda` commands at all. **Don't worry if
> you encounter this undesirable state! Just start a new shell or `source ~/.bashrc` if you are on
> a Linux or OSX system.**

## Installing a package into an existing environment

You can install a package into an existing environment using the `conda install` command. This
command accepts a list of package specifications (i.e., `numpy=1.18`) and installs a set of
packages consistent with those specifications *and* compatible with the underlying environment. If
full compatibility cannot be assured, an error is reported and the environment is *not* changed.

By default the `conda install` command will install packages into the current, active environment. The following would
activate the `basic-scipy-env` we created above and install [`Numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/), an open source JIT
(Just In Time) compiler that translates a subset of Python and `numpy` code into fast machine code, into the active
environment.

~~~
conda activate basic-scipy-env
conda install numba
~~~

{: .language-bash}

If version numbers are not explicitly provided, Conda will attempt to install the newest versions of any requested
packages. To accomplish this, Conda may need to update some packages that are already installed or install additional
packages. It is sometimes a good idea to explicitly provide version numbers when installing packages with the `conda
install` command. For example, the following would install a particular version of Scikit-Learn into the current,
active environment.

~~~
conda install scikit-learn=1.5
~~~

{: .language-bash}

> ## You can specify a version number for each package you wish to install
>
> In order to make your results reproducible and to make it easier for research colleagues to recreate your Conda
> environments on their machines it is sometimes a good practice to explicitly specify the version number for each
> package that you install into an environment.
>
> Many packages use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)  where there are three version numbers separated by
> decimal points e.g. 2.11.3. In this scheme the numbers have this meaning:
> *major_version*.*minor_version*.*patch_version*. Changes to  *patch_version* are for backwards compatible bug fixes,
> so we often only specify the first two numbers.
>
> If you are not sure exactly which version of a package you want to use, then you can use search to see what versions
> are available using the `conda search` command.
>
> ~~~
> conda search <PACKAGE_NAME>
> ~~~
>
> For example, if you wanted to see which versions of [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/),
> a popular Python library for machine learning, are available, you would run the following.
>
> ~~~
> conda search scikit-learn
> ~~~
>
> As always you can run `conda search --help` to learn about available options.
{: .callout}

When `conda` installs a package into an environment it also installs any required dependencies. For example, even though
`numpy` was not listed as a package to install when `numba` was installed `conda` will still install `numpy` into the environment because it is a required dependency of `numba`.

You can install multiple packages by listing the packages that you wish to install, optionally including the version you
wish to use.

~~~
conda activate basic-scipy-env
conda install ipython matplotlib=3.9 scipy=1.13
~~~

{: .language-bash}

> ## What actually happens when I install packages?
>
> During the installation process, files are extracted into the specified environment (defaulting to
> the current environment if none is specified). Installing the files of a Conda package into an
> environment can be thought of as changing the directory to an environment, and then downloading
> and extracting the package and its dependencies. Conda does the hard work of figuring out what
> dependencies are needed and making sure that they will all work together.
{: .callout}

Running the following command in the `basic-scipy-env` will fail as the requested `scipy` and `numpy` versions are
incompatible with Python 3.12 the environment was created with (`numpy=1.9.3` is quite an old version).

~~~
conda install scipy=1.9.3 numpy=1.9.3
~~~

{: .language-bash}

> ## Discussion

## Listing the contents of an environment

In addition to forgetting names and locations of Conda environments, at some point you will probably forget exactly what
has been installed in a particular Conda environment. Again, there is a `conda` command for listing the contents on an
environment. To list the contents of the `basic-scipy-env` that you created above, run the following command.

~~~
conda list --name basic-scipy-env
~~~

{: .language-bash}

## Deleting entire environments

Occasionally, you will want to delete an entire environment. Perhaps you were experimenting with `conda` commands and
you created an environment you have no intention of using; perhaps you no longer need an existing environment and just
want to get rid of cruft on your machine. Whatever the reason, the command to delete an environment is the following.

~~~
conda remove --name first-conda-env --all
~~~

{: .language-bash}
