## What are Conda channels?

Conda packages are downloaded from
remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. The `conda` command
searches a standard set of channels, referred to as `defaults`. The `defaults` channels include:

* `main`: The majority of all new Anaconda, Inc. package builds are hosted here. Included in
    `defaults` as the top priority channel.
* `r`: Microsoft R Open conda packages and [Anaconda, Inc.'s R conda packages](https://anaconda.org/r/repo).

Unless otherwise specified, packages installed using `conda` will be downloaded from the `defaults`
channels.

> ## The `conda-forge` channel
>
> In addition to the `defaults` channels that are managed by Anaconda Inc., there is another channel that also has
>
> a special status. The [Conda-Forge](https://github.com/conda-forge) project "_is a community led collection of
> recipes, build infrastructure and distributions for the conda package manager._"
>
> There are a few reasons that you may wish to use the `conda-forge` channel instead of the
> `defaults` channel maintained by Anaconda:
>
> 1. Packages on `conda-forge` may be more up-to-date than those on the `defaults` channel.
> 2. There are packages on the `conda-forge` channel that aren't available from `defaults`.

## My package isn't available in the `defaults` channels! What should I do?

You may find that packages (or often more recent versions of packages!) that you need to
install for your project are not available on the `defaults` channels.  In this case you could try the
following channels.

1. `conda-forge`: the `conda-forge` channel contains a large number of community curated Conda
    packages. Typically the most recent versions of packages that are generally available via the
    `defaults` channel are available on `conda-forge` first.
2. `bioconda`: the `bioconda` channel also contains a large number of Bioinformatics curated conda packages.
    `bioconda` channel is meant to be used with `conda-forge`, you should not worried about using the two channels
    when installing your prefered packages.

For example, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) publishes a Python 3 API that can be used to interact with Kaggle
datasets, kernels and competition submissions. You can search for the package on the `defaults` channels but you will
not find it!

Let's check whether the package exists on at least `conda-forge` channel.
Note that the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api)
suggest a different way to install.

it.

## Using `pip` and Conda

You can use the default Python package
manager [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install packages from [Python Package Index
(PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). However, there are a few [potential
issues](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment) that you should be aware of when using `pip` to
install Python packages when using Conda.

First, `pip` is sometimes installed by default on operating systems where it is used to manage any Python packages
needed by your OS. **You do not want to use `/usr/bin/pip` to install Python packages when using Conda
environments.**

~~~
(base) $ conda deactivate
$ which python
/usr/bin/python
$ which pip # sometimes installed as pip3
/usr/bin/pip
~~~

{: .language-bash}

> ## Windows users
>
> You can type `where.exe` in **PowerShell** and it does the same thing as `which` in **bash**.
{: .callout}

Second, `pip` is also included in the Miniconda installer where it is used to install and manage OS specific Python
packages required to setup your `base` Conda environment. **You do not want to use this `~/miniconda3/bin/pip` to
install Python packages when using Conda environments.**

~~~
$ conda activate
(base) $ which python
~/miniconda3/bin/python
$ which pip
~/miniconda3/bin/pip
~~~

{: .language-bash}

> ## Why should I avoid installing packages into the `base` Conda environment?
>
> If your `base` Conda environment becomes cluttered with a mix of `pip` and Conda installed
> packages it may no longer function. Creating separate Conda environments allows you to
> delete and recreate environments readily so you dont have to worry about risking your core
> Conda functionality when mixing packages installed with Conda and Pip.

If you find yourself needing to install a Python package that is only available via PyPI, then you should use the copy of
`pip`, which is installed automatically when you create a Conda environment with Python, to install the desired package
from PyPI. Using the `pip` installed in your Conda environment to install Python packages not available via Conda
channels will help you avoid difficult to debug issues that frequently arise when using Python packages installed via a
`pip` that was not installed inside you Conda environment.

> ## Conda (+Pip)
>
> Pitfalls of using Conda and `pip` together can be avoided by
> always ensuring your **desired environment is active** before installing anything using `pip`. This can be done by looking at the output of `conda info`.
